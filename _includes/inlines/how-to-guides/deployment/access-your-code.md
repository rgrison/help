## Public repositories

For public Git repositories, you don't need to add the SSH key provided to your Git account. You simply need to provide the Git URL as either

`http://<git provider>/<username>/<repository>.git`  

or   

`git://<git provider>/<username>/<repository>.git`



### Notice

We do not support the use of HTTPS URLs.


This URL is often generated by your Git provider automatically.


## Private repositories

For Cloud 66 to access your private repository (with read-only access), you first need to add the SSH provided to your Git account. Follow the instructions on the _Get started building your stack_ page, clicking the _How?_ link.

You can add this SSH key globally to your GitHub account by adding it to your _Account settings_ page, or allow access to a specific repository by adding it as a _Deploy key_ to that repository.

Once this is done, use a Git URL in the following format:

`git@<git provider>:<username>/<repository>.git`

This URL is often generated by your Git provider automatically.


### GitHub example

1.  Adding the SSH key globally
2.  Adding the SSH key to a specific repository

Once this is done, use a Git URL in the following format in the Cloud 66 UI:

`git@github.com:<username>/<repository>.git`


### BitBucket example

1.  Adding the SSH key globally
2.  Adding the SSH key to a specific repository

Once this is done, use a Git URL in the following format in the Cloud 66 UI:

`git@bitbucket.org:<username>/<repository>.git`
