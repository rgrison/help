## About using Cloud-A cloud
You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in [Cloud-A](https://www.clouda.ca/). Your servers and loadbalancer will be deployed in the _Default Network_ and will have public IP address from _Ext-Net_.

**Adding your Cloud-A credentials**

Visit the Cloud 66 Dashboard and select Get started building a stack. After connecting to your Git repository and analyzing your code, you will be asked to Add your cloud platform. From this menu, select Cloud-A and provide use your Cloud-A username as _Username_ and your password as _API Key_. 

### Notice
Should you wish to delete your stack on Cloud 66, your servers will not be deleted on your cloud provider unless physical server deletion is turned on.
