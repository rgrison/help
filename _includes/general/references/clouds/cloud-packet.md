## About using Packet cloud
You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in [Packet](https://www.packet.net/).

### Adding your Packet credentials
Visit the Cloud 66 Dashboard and select Get started building a stack. After connecting to your Git repository and analyzing your code, you will be asked to _Add your cloud platform_. From this menu, select Packet and provide your Packet API Key from _API Keys_ on your _Packet Dashboard_. 

### Notice
Should you wish to delete your stack on Cloud 66, your servers will not be deleted on your cloud provider unless physical server deletion is turned on.
