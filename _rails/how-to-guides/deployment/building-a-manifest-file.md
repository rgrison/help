## What is a manifest file?

A manifest file allows you to be more explicit about your stack composition and control settings that are not usually available through the user interface or Cloud 66 toolbelt. The file describes the setup of the components that run your stack. See [Getting started with manifest files](/rails/tutorials/getting-started-with-manifest.html) for an introduction.

For _Rails/Rack_ stacks, place a file called `manifest.yml` in a folder named `.cloud66`, that is in turn located in the root of your source code and checked into your repository.
Once you're ready, start by going through each section below to build your manifest file.


## Which environment?

The first level of your manifest file is the **environment** - this allows you to use the same `manifest.yml` for multiple stacks with different environments. Some examples are:

- production
- staging
- development

You can also use your own custom environment names in your manifest file.


## Which application?

Next, select which application you would like to specify settings for. You can choose from the following:

*   [ElasticSearch](#elasticsearch)
*   [Gateway](#gateway)
*   [GlusterFS](#glusterfs)
*   [Load balancers](#load-balancers)
*   [Memcached](#memcached)
*   [MongoDB](#mongodb)
*   [MySQL](#mysql)
*   [Nginx](#nginx)
*   [PostGIS](#postgis)
*   [PostgreSQL](#postgresql)
*   [Redis](#redis)
*   [Sinatra](#sinatra)
*   [Rails](#rails)

### ElasticSearch

- **version**: Specify the version of ElasticSearch you want to install.
- **root_disk_size** (_Optional, AWS EC2 and GCE only_): Default size of root disk (in GB) for servers in stack. Default value is 20.
- **root_disk_type** (_Optional, AWS EC2 and GCE only_): Disk type, accepted values being _ssd_ and _magnetic_. Default value is _ssd_.

```
production:
    elasticsearch:
        configuration:
            version: 0.90.7
            root_disk_size: 100
            root_disk_type: ssd
```

* * *


### Gateway

- **name**: Specify the name of gateway you want to use for your stack.
- **username** (_Optional_) Specify the username which should be used to connect to bastion server.


## Note
The gateway should be defined and open before you can use it in manifest.
```
production:
	gateway:
	    name: aws_bastion
	    username: ec2-user
```


### GlusterFS

- **version**: Specify the version of GlusterFS you want to install.
- **root_disk_size** (_Optional, AWS EC2 and GCE only_): Default size of root disk (in GB) for servers in stack. Default value is 20.
- **root_disk_type** (_Optional, AWS EC2 and GCE only_): Disk type, accepted values being _ssd_ and _magnetic_. Default value is `ssd`.
- **replica_count** : Number of nodes in _GlusterFS cluster_ which a data will be replicated on it(i.e replica count 2 means your data exist on two nodes). Default value is 1.
- **mount_targets** : List of _Servers_ and _Server Groups_ you need GlusterFS mounted on them. You can specify the name of the _server_ or _server group_ (i.e rails,docker,mysql,...). You can also use `app` and `db` keywords, `app` is your main app server group (i.e docker, rails, ...)  and `db` is your db server groups (i.e mysql,redis,postgresql,... ). Default value is `app`.
- **volumes**: List of volumes you want in your GlusterFS Cluster.  By default we are creating a volume called `cloud66-vol`  and mounted to `/mnt/data-store`.

Available settings for a volume are:

- **name**: Specify the name of volume.
- **mount**: Specify the mount point of the volume on clients.
- **access_control** (_Optional, Docker stacks only_): Specify the list of docker services which should have a _read only_ or _read/write_ attached volume, mounted to this glusterfs volume. Options are `read` and `write` (which includes read as well)

After you change the volume list, you need to redeploy your stack for new configuration be applied to your stack.



## Note

You can not change replica_count after GlusterFS added to your stack.


## Note

You can not use glusterfs group or any of its servers in mount_targets.


## Note

Renaming a volume will delete volume and create a new one.

```
production:
	glusterfs:
		configuration:
			version: 3.7
			replica_count: 2
			mount_targets: ['app','redis']
			volumes:
		  	- volume:
				name: images-data
				mount: "/mnt/images"
				access_control:
			  		read: ['web', 'api']
			  		write: ['web']
		  	- volume:

				access_control:
			  		read: ['web']
			  		write: ['web']
```

### Nginx

- **cors**: Enable [Cross Origin Resource Sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) - this will be taken into account when your Nginx configuration is reloaded.
- **extra-build-arguments**: (_applies to Rack/Passenger stacks only). Extra build argument string to be added the nginx build command. Note: if you require additional modules that themselves require specific source to be present, you should use a BEFORE_NGINX deploy hook to ensure that source is present. You can use the "cloud66/download" snippet to achieve this easily. The following build arguments are currently always added: "--with-http_realip_module --with-ipv6 --with-http_v2_module" regardless of this value.
- **perfect_forward_secrecy** (_deprecated_): Enable [Perfect Forward Secrecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy) - this will be taken into account when your Nginx configuration is reloaded.

```

            nginx:
                cors: true
                extra-build-arguments: "--add-module=/path/to/module"
                perfect_forward_secrecy: true # deprecated
```

### CORS configuration

If required, you can also specify the allowed origin (as '\*' or a single origin) and methods. For stacks created since 21st September 2016, you can also specify a comma-seperated list of origins, headers, and whether to allow credentials for CORS.

```
production:
    rails:
        configuration:
            nginx:
                cors:

## Which server?

Every application defined in the manifest file must be bound to a server. However, if you'd like configurations to apply to all servers in an application type, you don't need to specify a server type. Servers can be deployed specifically to host that application, be shared between multiple applications (eg. Rails and MySQL on the same server) or be an external server (eg. using an external database).

Here is an example of a server definition:

```
production:
    rails:
        servers:
          - server:
            unique_name: app
```

These are the parameters that the _server_ section can take:

- **unique_name** (_Required if you are specifying a server type_): A unique name for this server.
- **root_disk_size** (_Optional, AWS EC2 and GCE only_): Default size of root disk (in GB) for servers in stack. Default value is 20.
- **root_disk_type** (_Optional, AWS EC2 and GCE only_): Disk type, accepted values being _ssd_ and _magnetic_. Default value is _ssd_.
- **subnet_id** (_Optional, AWS EC2 only_): ID of the AWS subnet in which you would like to create your servers.
- **vendor** (_Optional, BYOC only_): Cloud vendor to fire the server up on. Valid values: aws, azure, digitalocean, googlecloud, linode, rackspace, and clouda
- **key_name** (_Optional, BYOC only_): Key name of the cloud vendor to fire the server up on. This is used when the account has multiple keys for a given cloud vendor. The default value is `Default` when omitted.
- **region** (_Optional, BYOC only_): [Data center region](http://developers.cloud66.com/#cloud-vendor-instance-regions) to create the server in.
- **size** (_Optional, BYOC only_): [Size of the server instance](http://developers.cloud66.com/#cloud-vendor-instance-names) created.
- **availability_zone** (_Optional, AWS EC2 only_): Availability zone of the server instance in AWS EC2 region.


<div class="notice notice-important">
Important!

Only a single cloud vendor and region is supported for servers in a stack.
</div>

```
production:
    rails:
      servers:
        server:
            unique_name: app
            vendor: aws
            key_name: Default
            region: us-east-1
            size: m3.medium
            root_disk_size: 100
            root_disk_type: ssd
            subnet_id: subnet-40000000
            availability_zone: us-east-1c
```

### Deploy to your own server

- **address** (_Optional, Registered Server only_): Address of the server, only applicable to Registered Servers. For Registered Servers, _unique_name_ and _address_ should be defined.

```
production:
    rails:
        server:
            unique_name: frontend
            address: 123.123.123.123
```

### Shared Servers

You can share a server between two applications. This could be in cases like using the same server for both your Rails app and the MySQL server behind it.

Each shared server definition specifies the name of another server definition in the manifest file for which the applications will then share the physical server:

{% highlight yaml %}
production:
    rails:
        server:
            same_as: *another_existing_servers_unique_name*
{% endhighlight %}


### External Servers

If you would like to use an external server for an application (like using your own MySQL or AWS RDS for example), you can define that server as external.

External server definitions specify that the application is hosted on a server external to Cloud 66. This is not a valid target for your main application (ie. Rails) but may be appropriate for another application type (ie. MongoDB):

```
production:
    mysql:
        server: external
```




<div class="notice notice-important">
Important!

You are <b>required</b> to specify a <a href="#which-server">server</a> for application types, whereas configurations are <b>optional</b>.
</div>


## Specify environment variables

You can add your environment variables to your manifest files.

Here is an example:

```
production:
    environment_variables:
        SOME_VARIABLE: value
        ANOTHER_ONE: another_value
        THIRD_ONE: AUTO_GENERATE
        LONG_ONE: AUTO_GENERATE_15
```

If you need to auto generate a value, you can use the `AUTO_GENERATE` keyword. It generates a 10 character long random string unless you specify the length after it: `AUTO_GENERATE_15` which generates a 15 character random string.

Environment variables set in your manifest file will only apply during the initial build of your stack. Please refer to our documentation on [environment variables](/rails/tutorials/env-vars.html) if you'd like to set them beyond this point.

Any environment variable that is generated by the result of the code analysis (like database addresses) will override any value specified in the manifest file. In other words, you cannot specify a value like `MYSQL_ADDRESS` in your manifest file as it will be ignored.


## Processes

[Background processes](/rails/how-to-guides/deployment/bluepill.html) can be deployed and managed by Cloud 66. Any process in a `Procfile` will be picked up, deployed and monitored by the system.

If you would like more flexibility over the signals used to control the processes, you can use the `procfile_metadata` section. Here is an example:

```
production:
  procfile_metadata:
    worker:
      stop_sequence: ttin, 120, term, 5, kill
    web:
      restart_signal: usr1
      web_server_stop_signals: usr1, 30, kill
    nsq:
      restart_on_deploy: false
```

In this example, a process called `worker` is stopped using a `TTIN` signal first. After waiting for 120 seconds, if the process is still running, a `TERM` signal will be sent. If it is still running after 5 seconds, it will be killed.

As for `web` or `custom_web` processes, you can specify a `restart_signal` which will be sent to the process serving web. This is useful for web servers that can do "phased" or zero-downtime restarts.

All processes restart during each redeployment of the stack. If you want to avoid this, you can set `restart_on_deploy` to `false`.

Default values for each process type are:

- Web/Custom Web Processes:
  - Stop Signal `web_server_stop_signals`: `QUIT`
  - Restart Signal `restart_signal`: `USR2`
- Non-Web Processes:
  - Stop Signal `stop_sequence`: `QUIT,30,TERM,11,KILL`
  - Restart `restart_on_deploy`: `true`


## Specify additional LiveLog files

Each application type supports the additional partial configuration to add custom live log files for that application type:

```
production:
    rails:
        configuration:
            custom_log_files: ["/tmp/mylog/*/*.log"]
```

For more information about **LiveLogs** and additional examples, please see the [LiveLogs help page](/rails/how-to-guides/deployment/shells/setting-up-custom-livelogs.html).


## Test experimental features

You can use some features that are still in beta by adding them to _experiments_ section of your manifest file, for example:

```
production:
    experiments:
        docker_storage: overlay
```

These are the parameters that the _experiments_ section currently accepts:

- **docker_storage** (_Optional_): If set to _overlay_, we will configure Docker on new servers to use OverlayFS backend storage.
