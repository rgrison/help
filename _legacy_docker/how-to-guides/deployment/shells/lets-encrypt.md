## How it is installed

A Let's Encrypt Python script called _acme_tiny.py_  puts a file with random name under `/etc/cloud66/webroot/` on one of your web servers. Then tries to connect to your server and download that file via HTTP. It needs 
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a non-secure HTTP endpoint</span> (/.well-known/acme_challenge/*) to invoke and reissue certificates.


### Note:

Let's encrypt needs to be updated every 3 months, so you'd need to keep the settings needed for issueing


## Troubleshoot

If during Lets Encrypt installation you get an error including something like this:

```
Wrote file to /etc/cloud66/webroot/FILENAME, but couldn't download http://DNS_NAME/.well-known/acme-challenge/FILENAME 
```

You need to go through the following steps:
1.  **Delete the SSL ceritficate** first and then carry on to the next step.
2.  If your infrastructure is behind [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) and your are using a global HTTPS redirect you need a [pagerule](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168306-Is-there-a-tutorial-for-Page-Rules-) to get things working. Make sure you add a [pagerule](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168306-Is-there-a-tutorial-for-Page-Rules-) because Let's Encrypt needs a non-secure HTTP endpoint (/.well-known/acme_challenge/*) to invoke and reissue certificates.
3.  Nginx Config
    
    There could be some parts missing in your Nginx config, probably due to customization or config file not being up to date. The following parts take care of redirections -like HTTP to HTTPS redirection or adding/removing www to the link- so that the file could be accessible via HTTP endpoint.
