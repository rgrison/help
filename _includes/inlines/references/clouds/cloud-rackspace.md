## About using Rackspace cloud
You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in any [Rackspace region](http://developers.cloud66.com/#cloud-vendor-instance-regions#rackspace). Note that if you hold a Rackspace UK account, you will be limited to creating servers in the London region. The Rackspace US account is able to create servers in the remaining regions.

### Generate a Rackspace API key
You need to provide your Rackspace API key in order for Cloud 66 to access your account. To generate a key, access the _Account_ dropdown in the top right of your Rackspace account, and go to the User Management page. Once there, click _Create a new user_, and fill in the necessary details for this new user. This user must be created with **Full Access** in order for servers to be created in your account.

Once you click Create user, you will be able to view the API Key by clicking Show.

### Add Rackspace key to a stack
Visit the Cloud 66 Dashboard and select _Get started building a stack_. After connecting to your Git repository and analyzing your code, you will be asked to _Add your cloud platform_. From this menu, select Rackspace and provide your API key. 

**Notice**

Should you wish to delete your stack on Cloud 66, your servers will not be deleted on your cloud provider unless physical server deletion is turned on.
