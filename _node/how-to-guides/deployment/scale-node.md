##  Scale your instances 

Your application is up and running but you need more capacity for your application or background jobs. Cloud 66 provides an easy mechanism for scaling up your application and running job instances. If your server has the capacity and is not fully utilized you can scale your application instances simply and quickly. Here is how:

*    Click on your stack
*    Click on your Node Server
*    Find the application (web) or job instance you want to scale
*    Scale up the instances by pressing the 'Scale up' (+) button
*    Hit scale
*    Wait a couple of seconds
*    Scaled up

If you need more capacity and your server is running low on resources (> 80% utilizisation) it's time to scale vertically and/or horizonally. [Please read this document how easy it is to scale your application with Cloud 66.](/node/tutorials/scaling.html)
